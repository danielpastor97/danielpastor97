### Hi folks ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Daniel and I am currently doing the second year of my PhD degree in Biophysical Chemistry, on the study of the phase behaviour of membrane models using coarse-grained molecular dynamic. I am also writing code for the [@ProLint](https://github.com/ProLint) project as part of my thesis, and trying to collaborate on other projects just for fun!
